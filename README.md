## Data Persistence

- Tasks are saved to a `tasks.json` file in the project root directory after each change.
- Dates (`createdAt` and `updatedAt`) are stored as human-readable ISO-8601 formatted strings.
- On startup, tasks are loaded from the JSON file if it exists.

## Dependencies

- **Jackson Databind** ‚Äî for JSON serialization and deserialization

## Code Highlights

- The `Task` class contains fields for `id`, `description`, `status`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt`.
- `TaskService` handles all task operations and manages JSON file reading/writing with proper date formatting.
- `CommandLineApp` provides the interactive command-line interface and parses user commands.
